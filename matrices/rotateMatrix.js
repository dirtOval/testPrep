//okay so you get fed a matrix of integers between 1 and 500
//and a string with up to 3 directions on it, either R or L.
//if L, rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise. if R, 90 degrees clockwise.

//I: a 2D array of integers, a string with up to three instructions
//O: that same 2D array, rotated according to the instructions
//C: maximum of 3 instructions, numbers will be between 1 and 500
//E: n/a

//okay so it's probably gonna help to draw some diagrams to figure this out

//[1, 2, 3]
//[4, 5, 6]
//[7, 8, 9]

//rotated to the right once

//[7, 4, 1]
//[8, 5, 2]
//[9, 6, 3]

//whereas if it was rotated to the left

//[3, 6, 9]
//[2, 5, 8]
//[1, 4, 7]

//bigger example

//[1, 2, 3, 4]
//[5, 6, 7, 8]
//[9, 10, 11, 12]
//[13, 14, 15, 16]

//rotated clockwise

//[13, 9, 5, 1]
//[14, 10, 6, 2]
//[15, 11, 7, 3]
//[16, 12, 8, 4]

//so we need to iterate through each instruction and and if it's right,
//make each row a column starting from the end
//whereas if it's left make each row a column starting from the beginning

//so there's a few cases to handle
  //if it's the first item in the row (j = 0) it goes to the end of the row
  //the middle elements depend on whether the length is even or odd
  //if it's odd it has a middle element that doesn't move
  //if odd it has inner elements that shift around

//so the row goes to the opposite column, index wise, e.g. row 0 becomes column 3
//row 1 becomes column 2, so on
//could we make it so that the number gets dropped into the row based on its column
//and its column based on its row?

//declare var result equal to array the length of the square, filled with arrays filled with 0s equal to length
//for each instruction
  //if it's R
    //for each row i
      //for each column j
        //result[j][result.length - 1 - i] = arr[i][j];
  //else if its L
    //for each row i
      //for each column j
        //result[result.length - 1 - j][i] = arr[i][j];
//return result
